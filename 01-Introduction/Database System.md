# Database System
Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information, ensure they are safe and avoid possible anomalous result.

## Applications
Database systems are used to manage collections of data that are:
- highly valuable

- accessed by multiple users and applications, often at the same time

Modern database systems exploit commonalities in the structure of data to gain efficiency but also allow for weakly structured data and for data whose format are highly variable.
